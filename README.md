# Outline

## Key Features

- Implementation of Neucube in Python
- Written with PyTorch for faster computations
- Ability to capture and process patterns in spatio-temporal data
- Spatio-temporal trained spiking feature extraction
- Integration of NeuCube with advanced Quantum Kernel

## Demostrations

- neucube_demo.py: existing NeuCube architecture
- neucube_improved_demo.py: an improved feature selection approach with the existing NeuCube architecture
- snn-qc_demo.py: an integrated advanced snn-quantum architecture 

## Installation

To use NeuCube-Py, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KEDRI-AUT/NeuCube-Py.git
```
or pip install
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KEDRI-AUT/NeuCube-Py.git
```
## Usage

The core functionality of NeuCube-Py revolves around the `reservoir` class, which represents the spiking neural network model. Here is a basic example of how to use NeuCube-Py:

```python
from neucube import Reservoir
from neucube.encoder import Delta
from neucube.sampler import SpikeCount

# Create a Reservoir 
res = Reservoir(inputs=14)

# Convert data to spikes
X = Delta().encode_dataset(data)

# Simulate the Reservior
out = res.simulate(X)

# Extract state vectors from the spiking activity
state_vec = SpikeCount.sample(out)

# Perform prediction and validation
# ...

```
